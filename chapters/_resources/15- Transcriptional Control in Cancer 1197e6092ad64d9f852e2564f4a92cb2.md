# BRD4

BRD4 is a member of the Bromodomain and Extraterminal (BET) family along
with BRD2, BRD3 and BRDT. It is a histone acetyltransferase that evicts nucleosomes from chromatin. In particular, BET inhibitors impair super-enhancer driven oncogene expression.

### Selective inhibition of Tumor Oncogenes by Disruption of Super-Enhancers

Super-enhancers associated genes were expressed at higher levels than enhancer-driven genes and specifically in mieloma cell line. The majority of super enhancer associated genes were previously shown to be involved in mieloma tumorigenesis e.g. MYC, CCND2. Treatment of MM1 cells with Brd4 inhibitor JQ1 resulted in reduced levels of BRD4 at enhancers and promoters.

JQ1 treatment lead to more pronounced reduction of BRD4 enrichment at super- enhancers showing almost complete loss of BRD4; in particular, super-enhancers are more sensitive to BRD4 inhibition than regular enhancers. MYC is among the most rapidly depleted genes upon BRD4 inhibition.

Genes associated with super-enhancers showed greater decrease in RNApol II at gene body than the ones associated with enhancers.

- Cancer cells can acquire super-enhancers (SE) as mechanism to drive oncogene expression
- SE are characterized by disproportionately high levels of BRD4 and Mediator, interacting with each other and with multiple cofactors
- SE are highly reliant on cooperatively interacting factors and lose activity more rapidly (than enhancers) when the levels of SE-bound factors are reduced
- BRD4 inhibition leads to preferential disruption of SE driving critical oncogenes in cancer cells

The molecular details underlining cancer cells addiction to BRD4 are being unveiled.

# YAP/TAZ

The transcriptional coactivators YAP (Yes-associated protein)/ TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) and their interactors.

The **HIPPO signalling** regulates YAP/TAZ and epithelial architecture and cell polarity are inhibitors of YAP/TAZ → EMT triggers inactivation of the Hippo cascade and YAP/TAZ activation.

Mechanical signals are ubiquitous, targeting every cell in every tissue. Mechanotransduction converge on YAP/TAZ in multiple cellular contexts. 

YAP and TAZ are nuclear effectors of mechanical signals exerted by ECM and cell shape:

Dupont et al., Nature 2011

The process of tumorigenesis is accompanied by collagen crosslinking, ECM stiffening, and increased focal adhesions. YAP/TAZ activity is controlled by cell shape and polarity through the cytoscheletal structure which also senses the topology and the rigidity of the extracellular matrix.

Cells probe the physical features of the microenvironment through integrins and adesive proteins responding to extracellular forces by adjusting their tensional state through the cytoscheleton activity. Physical and mechanical cues transmitted by the extracellular environment (i.e.: stiffness of the ECM) reach the nucleus at least in part by YAP/TAZ activation.

YAP/TAZ interact with the TEAD transcription factors to regulate gene expression.

# TEAD

![Screen Shot 2022-11-13 at 19-48-01.png](15-%20Transcriptional%20Control%20in%20Cancer%201197e6092ad64d9f852e2564f4a92cb2/Screen_Shot_2022-11-13_at_19-48-01.png)

TEAD is regulated by Hippo, Wnt, TGF-beta and EGFR pathway and is responsible for controlling drug resistance, metastasis, EMT and cancer stem cells. TEAD-driven transcriptional targets include well-established genes that are involved in cell growth, proliferation, and tissue homeostasis. YAP/TAZ drive several key attributes of cancer cells.

## YAP/TAZ/TEAD

Mapping YAP/TAZ/TEAD associations with chromatin in breast cancer cells reveals that these regulators associate with active enhancers. Hi-C analyses predict about 3000 genes regulated by YAP/TAZ/TEAD. 3C analyses confirmed YAP/TAZ/TEAD binding to MYC and TOP2A enhancers.

YAP/TAZ are required for activation of MYC and TOP2A enhancers.

YAP/TAZ-depleted cells stop proliferating and accumulate in G1.

TEAD depletion phenocopies YAP/TAZ depletion → TEAD is determinant for YAP/TAZ induced proliferation. Most YAP/TAZ motifs contained both TEAD and AP-1 motif.

Requirement of AP-1 for YAP/TAZ/TEAD induced transcription program tumorigenesis.

YAP/TAZ interact with the TEAD transcription factors to regulate gene expression. AP-1 enhances YAP/TAZ/TEAD transcription program and tumorigenesis

BRD4 inhibition impacts the YAP/TAZ transcriptional program in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line → **Brd4 is required for YAP/TAZ-mediated transcriptional regulation**. In addition YAP/TAZ are required for BRD4 recruitment to chromatin.

Conclusions:

- YAP/TAZ and BRD4 associate physically and functionally in breast cancer cell lines
- YAP/TAZ-BRD4 complex confers a transcriptional advantage to a broad YAP/TAZ targets the expression of these genes can be targeted by BET inhibitors
- Super-enhancers consist of YAP/TAZ-occupied enhancers showing strong enrichment of BRD4, high expression levels of regulated genes and higher sensitivity to BET inhibitors than average
- Oncogenic effect of BRD4 in association to YAP/TAZ offers a new perspective:
to stratify patients which are more likely to benefit from BET inhibitors, alone or in combination with other drugs
- Development of new therapeutic approach around YAP/TAZ-BET interaction surfaces

→ YAP/TAZ represent ideal candidates to mediate cancer-specific transcriptional addictions
and potential drug targets
