\hypertarget{r-loops}{%
\section{R-loops}\label{r-loops}}

RNA is quickly displaced as soon as it emerges from Pol II; during transcription RNA-DNA hybrid structure is required, but it is \emph{transient}. It has been observed that RNA can re-hybridize with the template DNA forming \textbf{RNA:DNA hybrid} and \textbf{R-loop structures} (Figure \ref{fig:hybrid}). R-loop formation results from a competition between the nascent RNA and the non-template DNA strand to hybridize with the template strand.

\end{figure}

High G density in the non-template DNA strand promotes R-loops formation. RNA:DNA hybrids rich in RNA-G/DNA-C ratio are more stable than DNA:DNA duplex of the same sequence.

Transcription unwinding results in topological stress and generation of DNA supercoils.
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Positive toroidal supercoils: dsDNA is tightly packed
\item
  Negative toroidal supercoils: loose DNA, predisposition to RNA insertion.
\end{itemize}

Superhelical stress can favor, and be mitigated by, R-loops formation.

In highly transcribed genes we witness histone turnover, which is favored by negative supercoiling. R-loops formation inhibit nucleosomes redeposition weakening surrounding nucleosome-DNA contacts.

G-rich sequences and negative supercoiling can promote the formation of R-loops

In addition, to win competition with the non-template strand, the stability of the sequence is important $\rightarrow$ G-quadruplexes highly increase stability.

\textbf{G-quadruplexes:} 4 guanines interacting by hydrogen bonds (Hoogsteen) on the same plane (planar quartet). We can find parallel G4 or antiparallel G4 (based on the orientation of guanines).

R-loops are typically formed co-transcriptionally (cis) but formation in trans has been reported and expected e.g.~Cas9 pathway or ncRNA with unwinding promotion.

\hypertarget{r-loop-degradation}{%
\subsection{R-loop degradation}\label{r-loop-degradation}}

TREX complex: mediates transcript export for splicing and translation. If we remove THO subunit, we impair trex and formation of R-loops $\rightarrow$ limiting the amount of naked RNA in the cells prevents R-loops accumulation.

R-loops are also actively eliminated by specific enzymes:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  RNAse H1/2 recognize and degrade R-loops
\item
  RNA:DNA helicases e.g.~Sen1/SETX
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-loop-recognition-and-distribution}{%
\subsubsection{R-loop recognition and distribution}\label{r-loop-recognition-and-distribution}}

\textbf{DRIP-seq:} The monoclonal S9.6 antibody revealed thousands of R-loop hotspots in human genome. R-loops can be found in:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  highly transcribed genes (as rate of transcription can influence loop formation for negative torsional stress)
\item
  telomeres: G-rich non-template strand, C-rich template strand
\item
  ORF: proposed function at termination sites for termination factor recruitment e.g.~chromatin remodeling.
\end{itemize}

! Pull down is performed after sonication, mechanic stress on DNA $\rightarrow$ bias. A good part of the signal could be coming from dsDNA. Over the years, improvements to the method were done e.g.~bisulphide for T$\rightarrow$U, only finds RNA.

Endogenous R-loop structures are also detected by \textbf{R-ChIP}: a catalytically dead RNASEH enzyme can be expressed in cells, able to recognize but not degrade. We visualize R-loops endogenously. Bias: RNASE can be recruited on paused sites, the technique can only applied in cell lines.

R-ChIP and DRIP-seq experiments reveal R-loops enrichment at promoter regions and TSS. Approximately 60\% human promoters are associated with a CGI - CGI methylation generally associates with gene silencing.

R-loops form in human CpG island promoters with G-rich sequence at the non-template strand (GC skew) regulate DNA methylation.

\hypertarget{vim-antisense1}{%
\subsection{VIM-antisense1}\label{vim-antisense1}}

VIM is an intermediate filament in mesenchymal cells (EMT process). There is a presence of a CpG island. Usually with antisense the transcription of the sense collides due to sterical hindrance (overlapping). In this case, the antisense is polyadenylated and nuclear, while the sense is cytoplasmic. The expression of the antisense is associated with down-regulation of the sense gene. Depletion of VIM-AS1 causes downregulation of the VIM gene expression caused by methylation (Figure \ref{fig:vim}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../_resources/Screen_Shot_2022-11-23_at_10-18-00.png}
\caption{}
\label{fig:vim}
\end{figure}

The two transcripts can be visualized through FISH with different fluorophores. By combining this technique with the inhibition of transcription VIM disappears, while VIM-AS1 is more stable. This could be due to the fact that it is engaged with a R-loop structure. The genomic region between the two TSSs shows GC skew sequences.

R-loop formation is dependent on the antisense transcript. RNaseH1 overexpression inhibits VIM and VIM-AS1 expression. R-loop structures promote VIM expression by impairing nucleosome occupancy and favoring the binding of transcription factors.

Expression of antisense and R-loop associate with open chromatin. By blocking R-loops or inhibiting VIM-AS1 at FNkB TF binding sites accessibility is reduced and the recruitment of the TF at the locus is impaired.

\hypertarget{main-findings}{%
\subsubsection{Main findings}\label{main-findings}}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  loop formation by antisense RNAs at CpG island containing promoters can impair DNA methylation at these promoter sequences
\item
  decrease nucleosome occupancy and favor binding of the transcription factor NF-kB to the promoter of Vimentin gene promoting transcription of the sense gene
\end{itemize}

R-loops can regulate gene expression by multiple mechanisms: repressing chromatin modifiers, activating chromatin modifiers and chromatin regulating complexes. They arise naturally and have multiple physiological effects e.g.~DNA repair, replication and gene expression, and are therefore tightly regulated. R-loops are generally transient and regulated by enzymatic activity; under certain conditions, R-loops become de-regulated and accumulate in cells.

\hypertarget{hottip-dependent-r-loop-formation-regulates-ctcf-boundary-activity-and-tad-integrity-in-leukemia}{%
\subsection{HOTTIP-dependent R-loop formation regulates CTCF boundary activity and TAD integrity in leukemia}\label{hottip-dependent-r-loop-formation-regulates-ctcf-boundary-activity-and-tad-integrity-in-leukemia}}

In vertebrates the Hox genes are located contiguously in clusters. Hox genes are expressed in a tightly regulated spatio-temporal manner during embriogenesis. They posses the homeobox domain and are divided into 4 clusters. The spatio-temporal expression is also observed in human primary fibroblast from different sites. 5C chromosome interaction highlights the presence of the \emph{posterior domain}. Differentiated cells (distal cells from limbs) have a distinct pattern with respect to proximal cells (from lung): in distal Pol II signal and H3K4me is observed in the first HOTTIP region, while the opposite patterns is present in proximal cells (HOTAIRM1 region at 3' $\rightarrow$ lncRNA interacting with chromatin remodelling complex).

HOTTIP stands for HOXA transcript at the distal tip. HOTTIP lncRNA stimulates the transcription of HoxA genes by enforcing H3K4me3 chromatin modification (Figure \ref{fig:hottip}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../_resources/Screen_Shot_2022-11-25_at_11-49-03.png}
\caption{}
\label{fig:hottip}
\end{figure}

Chromosomal looping brings HOTTIP RNA in close proximity to the HOXA genes. HOTTIP lincRNA binds to and targets WDR5--MLL complexes to the HOXA locus, leading to transcription activation. The mutual interdependence between HOTTIP RNA and WDR5-MLL creates a positive feedback loop that maintains the ON state of the locus.

HOX genes are mutated or deregulated in different cancers and play active roles in tumorigenesis. HOXA genes are expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells while downregulated during differentiation. Abnormal HOXA gene activation is a common feature of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). HOXA9 and HOXA10 genes are frequently aberrantly activated in AML patients. Dysregulation of HOXA genes (e.g., HOXA9) is a driving mechanism for hematopoietic deregulation and leukemogenesis. Overexpression of HOXA9 is a poor prognostic marker in leukemia patients while its downregulation is a favorable predictor of AML patient outcome. The mechanisms regulating HOXA genes expression in AML patients is under investigation.

A transition from repressive to active chromatin is detected within the HOXA locus in AML patients. Among A7 and A9 we observe a sort of boundary, mainly regulated by insulator sequences $\rightarrow$ the CTCF binding site located between HOXA7 and HOXA9 genes may regulate the aberrant activation of the HOXA9-13 genes in AML cells.

Deletion of the CTCF binding site between HOXA7/9 genes (CBS7/9+/-) alters HOXA gene expression in AML cell lines. The homozygous deletion was incompatible with cell survival, so heterozygous was used. ChIP-seq analyses of CBS7/9+/- cells show altered chromatin structure in the HOXA9-13 domain but not in the HOXA1-7 locus, consistent with a loss of boundary function. 4C-seq data indicate decreased HOXA9 interaction with proximal genomic sites.

\textbf{CBS7/9+/- is important to regulate the chromatin structure and the expression of HOXA9-13 genes in AML cells}

Dysregulation of CBS7/9 boundary inhibits leukemic cell proliferation and prolongs survival time of transplanted NSG mice. In addition to the local effect on chromatin marks and structure, a significant number of dysregulated genes was observed e.g.~oncogenic pathways RUNX1, SOX involved in myeloid activation.

Attenuation of the chromatin boundary disrupts the active chromatin domain and perturbs oncogenic gene expression in AML, in part by disrupting the HOXA9 oncogenic pathway. The CBS7/9 boundary located at the edge of the TAD encompassing the posterior HOXA genes establishes and maintains aberrant chromatin signatures and expression of the posterior HOXA genes to facilitate myeloid leukemogenesis. The elimination of CTCF fosters the formation of aberrant protein.

\emph{Can a normal CTCF boundary be hijacked to control oncogenic chromatin domain and transcription profiles for leukemic transformation and progression?}

HOTTIP--/-- perturbs HOXA gene-mediated oncogenic transcription program, we observe oncogene downregulation. The KO is able to recapitulate the effect of CBS7/9 on HOXA. In wt AML cells we can identify the anterior and posterior domain, in KO cells we observe a change in the posterior domain.

HOTTIP lncRNA is aberrantly expressed in a subset of AML patients and cells. NPM1-mutated (NPM1C+)or MLL-rearranged (MLLr+) AML cases (n = 76) exhibited elevated levels of HOTTIP expression. Survival rate was inversely correlated with HOTTIP expression.

Activation of HOTTIP rescues the HOXA gene chromatin defects in the CBS7/9+/-- AML cells.

HOTTIP transgenic expression in hematopoiesis leads to AML-like disease and promotes hematopoietic transcription programs.

\textbf{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  HOTTIP expression alters HOXA genes containing TADs and HOXA genes expression
\item
  HOTTIP KO affects leukemic transcription program while HOTTIP overexpression leads to AML-like disease
\item
  HOTTIP is aberrantly expressed in AML patients

CHIRP: reminds us of ChIP for crosslinking and sonication. Instead of using antibodies, they use specific probes for RNA of interest with tilling oligos (bp with different regions of the RNA, increased yield of the pull down). At the end of the protocol we obtain RNA.

HOTTIP interactome isolated from AML cells contains CTCF/cohesin complex and R-loop- associated proteins.

HOTTIP KO resulted in a in a significant reduction of R loops and HOTTIP binding sites, especially when cobound to CTCF.

No signal from GRO-Seq $\rightarrow$ HOTTIP KO disrupted CTCF and cohesin TAD boundaries containing AML oncogenes such as $\beta$-catenin (CTNNB1). At these boundary sites HOTTIP RNAs form R-loops in trans. HOTTIP-mediated R-loop formation directly contributes to CTCF boundary activity.

R-loops disruption at the CBS-u2 boundary site impairs proliferation of AML cells.

\hypertarget{dna-damage}{%
\section{DNA damage}\label{dna-damage}}

Single stranded DNAs are more susceptible to chemical modifications, strand breaks, mutagen sensitivity and secondary structure than dsDNAs. Also dsDNA is undergoing spontaneous chemical modifications. Basically, any covalent bond in DNA molecule can be attacked by a water molecule. It has been estimated that there are thousands of spontaneous lesions in our cells e.g.~depurination (G$\rightarrow$sugar phosphate) or deamination (C$\rightarrow$U). Spurious methylation can occur in bases different from cytosine; when a RNA pol II passes through modified bases, we can observe a stall or the insertion of an erroneous base, leading to mutations. The addition of chemical groups occurs when bases react with oxygen species e.g.~guanine + adduct radical gives 8-hydroxyguanine.

\textbf{Base excision repair} (BER) pathway eliminates modified bases or depurinated nucleotides (Figure \ref{fig:ber}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../_resources/Screen_Shot_2022-11-30_at_08-49-05.png}
\caption{Base excision repair}
\label{fig:ber}
\end{figure}

The chemical modification rate in oligonucleotides depends on cation concentration, pH, and other experimental conditions. Roughly 5\% of the genome can be occupied by R-loops.

\hypertarget{r-loop-modified-bases}{%
\section{R loop modified bases}\label{r-loop-modified-bases}}

Modified bases within R-loops that are not properly repaired form nicks and breaks (this step requires dsDNA) $\rightarrow$ replication and transcription stops. R-loops accumulation associates with genome instability due to the spontaneous base modifications occurring at ssDNA and the ensuing processing events leading to nicks and breaks.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../_resources/Screen_Shot_2022-11-30_at_08-51-07.png}
\caption{R loop repair}
\label{fig:rrep}
\end{figure}

Thanks to R-loop displacement, BER can excite modified bases; this provokes a misaligned dsDNA, leading to breakages - especially if loops are hit by modifications - and genome instability (Figure \ref{fig:rrep}).

R-loops can lead to nicks and breaks (DSBs) also due to the activity of the AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases (catalyzed modifications). \textbf{Activation-induced cytidine deaminase} (AID) promotes somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes in germinal center (GC) B cells. AID off-target activity has been implicated in malignant transformation of GC-derived B cell lymphomas.

C$\rightarrow$U is meant to be, as cells want to induce mutation in a random manner to achieve hypervariability. In particular, several cancers are characterized by APOBEC signatures, which are a key source of mutation e.g.~chromosome instability in early breast and lung cancer evolution. Not only \emph{spontaneous} base modifications but also cytosine deamination catalyzed by \textbf{APOBECs} can lead to nicks and breaks within R-loops structures leading to genome instability.

\hypertarget{apical-kinases}{%
\subsection{Apical kinases}\label{apical-kinases}}

Cells have evolved the \textbf{DNA damage response} (DDR) in order to combat threats
posed by DNA damage. Breaks are sensed by apical kinases: \textbf{ATM}, \textbf{ATR} and \textbf{DNA-PKcs} (Figure \ref{fig:apical}). Phosphorylated serine or threonine residues followed by glutamine (S/T-Q) S/T-Q sites are present in ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs for autophosphorylation. They all contain a kinase domain at the C-terminal. Cancer cells and immunodeficient cells (mutated in these genes) are more susceptible to radiation, since the recognition of ds breaks is impaired $\rightarrow$ radiotherapy would result in important side effects.

ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs require specific co-factors for their recruitment to
damaged DNA. ATM is linked to a trimeric complex (MRN), where MRE11 is the endo/exo nuclease, RAD50 recognizes dsDNA and NBS1 is full of PPinteracting domain (ATM recruitment). ATR is recruited to dsbreaks when they are processed, so ssDNA bound by RPA (aspecific marker), bound by ATRIP co-factor.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../_resources/Screen_Shot_2022-11-30_at_09-11-05.png}
\caption{Apical kinases}
\label{fig:apical}
\end{figure}

They are also involved in cell cycle control, DNA replication, transcriptional regulation and RNA metabolism. It orchestrates real cell response.

\textbf{DNA-PKcs} promotes NHEJ of DSBs: DNA-PKcs phosphorylation allows the recruitment of downstream NHEJ core factors, leading to DNA-end ligation by LIG4. This pathway is fast and can be used in all cell cycle phases.

ATM activation promotes a signaling cascade on damaged chromatin. MRN recruits ATM, which can phosphorylate hundreds of different targets, which are themselves kinases $\rightarrow$ kinase cascade. The first event is the phosphorylation of H2AX, leading to gamma H2AX marker for DNA damage. MDC1 is recruited and phosphorylation, additional MRN recruitment and feed-forward mechanism. Gamma H2AX can spread megabases, self sustaining cycle enhancing the reaction to ds break. TIP60 activates ATM through acetylation.

53BP1 is an effector of DNA damage response (reaction of the cell to ds break, enabling sensing) and DNA repair mechanism (fix the break) $\rightarrow$ NHEJ activation. Among the ATM targets we have BRCA1 (scaffold molecule and ubiquitinligase) and CtIP (endonuclease), which are phosphorylated $\rightarrow$ signal for the cell to activate homologous recombination (requires the sister chromatid, S phase only).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../_resources/Screen_Shot_2022-11-30_at_09-16-55.png}
\caption{Blackford and Jackson, \emph{Mol Cell}, 2017}
\end{figure}

\textbf{BRCA1 and 53BP1 determine the choice of repair mechanism between NHEJ
and HR.} The decision between NHEJ and HR is also determined by several factors including cell cycle phase, chromatin state, genetics. NHEJ is ``error prone'' (but not in the classic pathway, alternative one), while homologous recombination is error free.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../_resources/Picture1.jpg}
\caption{Trenner and Satori, Frontiers in Oncology 2019}
\end{figure}

DNA damage response integrates regulation of the cell cycle, which is blocked in order to prevent mitosis. It is necessary to allow repair mechanism to act before resuming the cell cycle. Cell cycle is regulated by CHK2 (kinase phosphorylating CDK29) and p53.

The key signal for the cell in the context of repair comes from DNA ends; telomere mask chromosome ends from being recognized as double-strand breaks.

DNA damage response (DDR) involves DNA lesion recognition followed by a signaling cascade to promote DNA repair. The effectors lead to transient checkpoint, cellular senescence and apoptosis.

The roles o\textbf{f PARP1} (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) in detection and repair of DNA double-strand breaks are several. It is recruited to ds break and adds poly(ADP-ribose) chains. The recruitment of covalently and non-covalently modified proteins to site of DNA damage allows for repair of ssDNA nicks and breaks, sd breaks and chromatin modifications. PARP is also associated with ATM itself and is involved in HR, cNHEJ and aNHEJ. Although it is not the only activating mechanism of BRCA, it supports it to the break and lead to strand invasion and resolution.

Summarizing, defects in DSB repair e.g.~loss or Xrcc4, LIG4, BRCA1 lead to chromosome instability and accumulation of mutation $\rightarrow$ defective checkpoints, cancer.

\hypertarget{topoisomerases}{%
\subsection{Topoisomerases}\label{topoisomerases}}

Programmed ssDNA and dsDNA breaks occur during transcription. As we have mentioned, positive and negative torsional stress generate forces opposing the direction of pol II. Topoisomerase cleavage complexes (TOPcc) assemble at sites of topological stress. They are tightly regulated to minimize deleterious cleavage complexes - their activity is impeded by nucleosomes. They are recruited to chromatin via interaction with chromatin remodelling complexes (SWI/SNF), histone chaperones (FACT) and helicase enzymes (WRN).

TOP1 triggers SSBs or nicks, TOP2 induces DSBs. Both perform breakage in a controlled manner and once torsion is released they can exert ligation activity. During transcription TOP1 and TOP2 enzymes relieve positive supercoils while TOP1 and TOP3 counteract negative supercoils.

\hypertarget{a-topoisomerase-iib-mediated-dsdna-break-required-for-regulated-transcription}{%
\subsubsection{A topoisomerase IIb-mediated dsDNA break required for Regulated Transcription}\label{a-topoisomerase-iib-mediated-dsdna-break-required-for-regulated-transcription}}

Biotin-dUTP labelying by terminal deoxy .. $\rightarrow$ only if a break is present. Amplification of the promoter region and not of the ORF, signaling the presence of a break in the promoter leading to the recruitment of PARP. However the break is transient, after 10 minutes it disappears (Figure \ref{fig:biot}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../_resources/Screen_Shot_2022-11-30_at_10-03-17.png}

\label{fig:biot}
\end{figure}

DSBs are induced transiently on the pS2 promoter upon estrogen treatment. Transcriptional activation associates with transient and local formation of DNA double strand breaks. TopoII$\beta$-mediated DSBs at the pS2 promoter is required for pS2 transcription. If we block topoisomerases, machinery for transcription is not recruited. The presence of DNAPK persists for a while after the resolution of the break, this does only mean that the signal is spreading.

TopoIIb/PARP-1 complex in nuclear receptor-mediated gene regulation TopoII mediated DSB and in PARP-1 activity serves as mechanism for gene transcription upon ligand or signal- dependent stimulation. PARP1 activity promotes removal of histone H1 from the ERE-containing nucleosome supporting transcription initiation.

\hypertarget{brca1}{%
\subsubsection{BRCA1}\label{brca1}}

Sometimes, patological topoisomerase 2 sites are observed. OP2 is required for ER-medited transcription. Occasional estrogen-induced pathological TOP2 occur with DSBs covalently associated with the enzyme. BRCA1 participates in resolving these structures promoting genome integrity. In the absence of BRCA1 estrogen exerts a genotoxic effect with accumulation of DSBs during cell divisions.

The roles of BRCA1 in the maintenance of genome integrity and regulation of transcription may be the key of its tissue specific tumor suppressor function.BRCA1 has an ubiquitinylase domain (RING) and a huge number of interacting proteins. BRCA1 drives a transcriptional program supporting differentiation of luminal progenitors to mature luminal cells. BRCA1 interaction inhibits ER$\alpha$ activity directly and by promoting mono-ubiquitination of ER$\alpha$. BRCA1 mutant progenitors are aberrantly proliferative and defective in differentiation giving rise to tumors of luminal origin. Cells with LOH in BRCA1 usually show basal-like tumor activity.

\hypertarget{stark-et-al.}{%
\subsubsection{Stark et al.}\label{stark-et-al.}}

24h estrogen treatment activates DNA damage response pathways and associates with DSBs in MCF7 cells. \textbf{Comet assay:} cells are lysate, nuclei as inserted in an agarose pad and placed under an electrophoretic chamber (no fragmentation): if there are ds breaks it will move a little bit, we will observe a ``comet'' signal. In 24 hours cells can cycle and perhaps this is not the same break as topoisomerase II. Long term estrogen treatment results in greater DDR activation than short term treatments.

DNA damage induced by long term estrogen treatment is replication dependent, the more the cell proliferate, the more the DNA damage response is activated. If a Cdc7 inhibitor, DNA damage response activation is impacted. Flavopiridol (inhibits Cdk9) results in Pol II elongation impairment, but does not affect replication.

Estrogen induces R-loops formation at ER responsive genes. The induction of R loop was depending on ER target genes. Gene responsive to estrogen are enriched in genomic rearrangements in breast tumors. Somatic mutation data from whole genome seq of 560 breast tumors determining whether the mutation sites are enriched in estrogen responsive loci.

Estrogen induced R-loops colocalize with DNA damage markers on chromatin. Proximity ligation assays suggest that estrogen induced R-loops occur on chromatin marked by DNA damage.

RNaseH expression reduces estrogen induced DNA damage. RNaseH expression reduces estrogen induced DSBs. R-loops may be involved in DNA damage induction DSBs formation in breast cancer cells upon estrogen treatment.

LECTURE 21

\subsection{Causes of genetic instability (from last lecture)}
R-loops: accomulation due to spontaneous base modification at ssDNA,
R-loops accumulations lead to nicks and breaks. Not only R-loops tho,
and the problem is not only spontaneous modifications of the basis. Also
cytosine deamination catalized by APOBECs can lead to nicks and breaks
within R-loops structures leading to genome instability. Topoisomerase
II is required to relieve the superhelical structures once the
transcription started. There also cases however in which it causes
breaks that become pathological (and need to be fixed).\\

If we think about it, one of the hallmarks of cancer is gene instability
(chromosome re-arrangement), which need some sort of break for it to
happen!. Compare DNA in pre-cancerous and cancerous tissue (and normal).
The more aggressive is the cancer, the lest the response of DNA repair
genes. Immunohistochemistry in human bladder.

There are different ways to induce oncogenes, what we know is that upon
activation cell proliferate, until they reach a plateau (oncogene
induced senecence: persistent activation od DDR pathways.) DIfferent
form replicative senesence (telomers). There no way to recover from it
(both oncogenic or replicative), unless we act \emph{genetically}.

DDR
induced by oncogene expression acts as a barrier to cell proliferation!
We can bypass this barrier by over expressing genes like RAS, or
downregulating genes like p53:

The link between activation of oncogenes and senescence has something to
do with DNA replication stress. In precancerous lesions that typically
retain wildtype p53 function, the oncogene induced DNA damage elicits
p53- dependent apoptosis and/or senescence, which limits growth of the
lesion. When the function of p53 is lost, cells can escape its apoptotic
and/or senescence effects, and the precancerous lesion can become
cancerous.

\hypertarget{replication-stress}{%
\subsubsection{Replication stress}\label{replication-stress}}

How does replication start? It is tightly regulated in time and space.
Two main steps: licensing and origin finding. The input for initiation
is phosphorilation, mediated by a bunch of kinesis (like CDK).

%\includegraphics{../_resources/cf33180a017e8d51c049566410ac8b20.png}
There are many more licensed origins than the ones that are actually
used. Some are used early, some later, some never at all and are used as
backup if something goes wrong.

If an oncogene is to induce proliferation, it has to induce these steps.
MYC, but also RAS and map kinasis also promote proliferation.

$\rightarrow$ Oncogene expression leads to transient upregulation of
CDC6, and leads to altered replication timing. At the end, oncogenes all
push the cell to enter phase S.
%\includegraphics{../_resources/32b183547f544448275d6f43d7693d7e.png} We
end up with premature origin activation: maybe this is the reason why in
the previous fish experiment we see many dots of replication, but
diploidy is maintained.

\textbf{Oncogene activation induces replication stress} All the
conditions in the first part of the picture (basically the premature of
firing of all replicative factors, without the licensed origins, limited
dNTPs) lead to some aberration to the chromosomes.
%\includegraphics{../_resources/212276fa882f51c9df6ee225d31e5bae.png}

RPA binds to the lagging single strand left behind.  ATR tries to fix
the problem by blocking late origin firing and stabilizes (prevents
collapse) of the replication fork. Also a DSB can recruit ATR.
%\includegraphics{../_resources/13c8849fd53903e2747fc9cc1a31fa57.png} We
now have a system that wants to push to S phase, unleashing oncogenic
products.

tumors}\label{chromosome-abnormalities-due-to-pre-mitotic-defects-are-frequently-found-in-tumors}}

Mainly due to mitotic defects, which leads to a lagging chromosome. In
pre-mitotic defects (the majority of the cases), in most cases we will
find acentric chromosomes or the presence of bridges.

Pharmacological induction of replication stress in HCT116 (CIN-) results
in s\textbf{structural chromosome aberrations and segregation errors}.
Aphridicolin simulates stalled replication, by treating cells with no
defects we see the emergence of new defects, proving once again that
replication stress is the driving factor for DNA defects. Stress can be
found both in the chromosomes, but also at the end of the chromosomes.
However, nucleosides supplementation CIN+ cell lines reduces DNA damage
and segregation error frequency.

A few key points: 
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item Activated oncogenes cause replicative stress
characterized by increased numbers of stalled and collapsed replication
forks, accounting for early DNA damage
\item Under physiologic conditions,
DDR induced by stalled replication forks triggers a cell cycle arrest
and promotes replication fork restart or activation of dormant origins
of replication and DNA repair
\item Stalled replication forks induced by
activated oncogenes are not able to restart, due to the constitutive
insult. Under these conditions, the induced DDR triggers a persistent
state of growth arrest known as oncogeneinduced senescence
\item In the
early stages of cancer, replicative stress which may be able to promote
genome instability, induces a DNA damage response acting as an
anticancer barrier inducing senescence or apoptosis
\item When further
genetic or epigenetic changes down-regulate or impair the DDR signaling
(i.e ATM, ATR pathway) tumorigenesis can proceed.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{transcription-replication-conflicts}{%
\subsubsection{Transcription replication
conflicts}\label{transcription-replication-conflicts}}

The problem is when oncogenes become aberrant: in normal situation we
need them to be functional!
%\includegraphics{../_resources/61c42671b1b95714d2335e1c23a75024.png}

Transcription is a natural obstacle to replication fork progression. In
aberrant replication, DNA will be broken in different sites. No good.
Transcription replication conflicts can induce replication stress
threatening genome stability. Transcription-replication conflicts can
occur head-on or co-directional. There's a reason why the OR is close to
the gene promoter!

\textbf{Common fragile sites (CFS)} are loci prone to form breaks upon
replication stress and associate with recurrent rearrangements in
cancer. Indeed, there's evidence that oncogene-induced replication
stress preferentially targets common fragile sites in preneoplastic
lesions.

\subsubsection{Increased global transcription activity as a mechanism of

cancer}\label{increased-global-transcription-activity-as-a-mechanism-of-replication-stress-in-cancer}}

To study the increased activity, H-RAS is tracked, as its expression
associates with increased overall transcription. H-RAS expression also
associates with increased R-loops formation. Interestingly, \textbf{RAS
expression induces replication stress}.

Transcription inhibitor is added to the system, then the replication is
partially rescued $\rightarrow$ RAS-induced replication stress is
promoted by ongoing transcription. In the paper they also proposed a
model based on the fact that TBP is induces by RAS singalling. More TBP
$\rightarrow$ more promoters activated. Its depletion decreases the
production of mRNA. Increased transcription activity is a mechanism
contributing to (a more direct) replication stress in cancer.

\textbf{Main points:} 
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item Oncogene expression/activation boosts
replication, transcription, R-loops formation leading to replicative
stress and activation of DDR 
\item DDR activation signals cell cycle block,
senescence or apoptosis, acting as tumor suppressor pathway
\item Impaired
DNA repair mechanisms allow accumulation of mutations
\item If mutations in
DDR pathways occur cells can bypass replicative stress, continuing
proliferating despite accumulating DNA lesions with consequent genome
instability
